# FAZON Proof Embed — Codex Phase Token Implementation

This repository documents the public verification and timestamp of the FAZON Codex Phase token implementation.  
It serves as a dual-verification anchor between GitHub and Zenodo (DOI), ensuring the transparency and authenticity of FNFT-based access control mechanisms.

## 🧠 Purpose

This proof page and metadata declaration are part of the **FAZON Phase Identity Framework**, anchoring the issuance and logic of the **Codex Phase Token**:

- 🛡 Verifies timestamped issuance of access logic
- 🔁 Ensures reproducibility of FNFT-based access validation
- 🧬 Supports the philosophical model behind Phase-locked distribution
- 📦 Offers long-term, open-access verification via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)

---

## 🔒 Use Case

The FAZON Codex Phase token is used for gated access to protected TR-2 content layers.  
This embed page verifies the issuance, signature structure, and archival identity of the token.

All access validations are cryptographically enforced via the **FNFT (Fractional NFT)** protocol stack.
